Steps to Deploy to Azure
========================

1.  **Create a Resource Group**
   
2.  **Create a SQL Database inside this Resource Group.**  This will require you
    to create a SQL Server first if you don't already have one or specify one.
    This is also where you configure your db server with a admin username and
    password.

3.  **Add a Firewall Rule** to allow our development machine access so we can manage the database.
   
4.  **Connect to db using SSMS or SQL Server Object Explorer and run UP script**

5.  **Get the Connection String**
   
6.  **Create Web App on Azure**

7.  **Deploy Web App to this web app and configure connection string**
